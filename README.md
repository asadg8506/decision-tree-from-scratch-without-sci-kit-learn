Tree-based regression model built from scratch using Python.




# 🌳 Decision Tree from Scratch (No Scikit-Learn)

This project implements a **regression decision tree** from scratch using only **NumPy** and **Pandas**—without relying on any machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict **sales** based on features like quantity ordered, price, and date fields using a custom-built Decision Tree.

You’ll learn how:
- A Decision Tree splits data.
- Thresholds are calculated.
- Predictions are made recursively.
- Metrics like **MSE** and **R² Score** are computed.

## 📂 Dataset

📁 Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data
The project uses a sample sales dataset (`sales_data_sample.csv`) with features such as:
- `QUANTITYORDERED`
- `PRICEEACH`
- `MONTH_ID`
- `YEAR_ID`

Target column: `SALES`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas

No external ML libraries were used.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-from-scratch.git
